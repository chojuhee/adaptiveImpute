# adaptiveImpute

This repository contains 

1) an R package 'AdaptImpute' which implement the Adaptive-Impute algorithm proposed in the paper,
"Intelligent Initialization and Adaptive Thresholding for Iterative Matrix Completion; Some Statistical and Algorithmic Theory for 
Adaptive-Impute", and

2) R codes for Figures 1-4 and Tables 1-4 that we present in Section 5 in the same paper.
